# R-Final-Project
This is my final project for my Introduction to R class at Montclair State University (CSIT 275). I enjoyed working with the dataset I found which delt with Covid-19 data. In this class we learned a lot about some of the popular packages that data scientists and data analysts use in their day to day work. Utalizing the ggplot and leaflet packages I was able to create visualizations that tell the story of happiness trends in certain regions and what individual facotrs influenced them more. Please let me know what you think and what can be done better in the future.
